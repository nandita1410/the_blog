          <p>The best infographics can take dry data, complex information or a confusing timeline, and make them clear as crystal. It's almost the perfect encapsulation of what good design, illustration and animation are about: communicating a story or an idea visually, in a way that instantly connects with people, in a way that a lot of raw text can never do.</p>
